<h1> General Description of Functionality </h1>
<p>fotostor. was conceived as a platform idea for artists to use a social media platform to help spread the reach of their work and to help monetise their work at the same time. Users can register on the platform and receive suggested posts through an algorithm that determines what's popular at the moment. Users can follow other users and get suggested posts based on posts they like on their feed, as well as enable the ability to sell clothing, prints, and licensing rights of their work to other users on the platform. Users can also purchase other artist's works, modify their profile picture and biography.
  
On the e-commerce side of the functionality, users can set their address to purchase clothing, licenses, and prints of the work they wish to purchase and place it in a shopping basket. Once the order has been processed through Stripe, the user receives an email with a receipt of what they've ordered, and if they've purchased a license, a link to the work in question.</p>
